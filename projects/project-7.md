Keywords: ROS; industrial robot arms; motion control

I introduced the following software and hardware techniques to the veterans:
1. Basic usage of ROS
2. Installing Linux and using ROS on a microcontroller
3. Programming and controlling the robot arm using ROS

The workshop went virtual due to the pandemic. We managed to stream the hands-on demonstration online.
